Description:
This project is a simple calculator designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Files:

3. script.js: Implements the functionality of the calculator using JavaScript.

Instructions:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

HTML Structure:
The HTML structure of the calculator is divided into two main sections: the calculator display and the calculator buttons. The display section is a text input field where the user can see and enter numbers and calculations. The buttons section consists of various buttons representing numbers, operators, and other functionalities.

CSS Styling:
The style.css file is responsible for the visual design of the calculator. It sets the dimensions, colors, and positioning of the calculator display and buttons. You can modify the CSS file to customize the calculator's appearance according to your preferences.

JavaScript Functionality:
The script.js file contains the JavaScript code that enables the calculator's functionality. It handles button clicks, performs the necessary calculations, and updates the display accordingly. The code includes event listeners for button clicks, helper functions for arithmetic operations, and logic to handle user inputs.
